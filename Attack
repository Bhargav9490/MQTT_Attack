Manipulating Sensor Data to Trigger False Alarms in an IoT System
Overview
In an IoT-based monitoring system, multiple sensors (such as gas sensors, air quality sensors, and light sensors) are connected to an MQTT broker. The system continuously monitors sensor readings to detect unsafe environmental conditions and trigger alarms when threshold values are exceeded. However, this system is vulnerable to attacks that exploit the MQTT protocol, allowing an attacker to inject false sensor data and manipulate readings.

Vulnerability / Attack Type
Protocol: MQTT
Attack: Data Manipulation / Message Injection
Technology Focus
Internet of Things (IoT): This attack targets IoT devices using the MQTT protocol to communicate sensor data.
Scenario Explanation
An attacker uses an MQTT client, such as Mosquitto Client, to publish false data to specific topics associated with critical sensors. By doing so, the attacker manipulates the sensor readings, making it appear as though dangerous conditions exist when, in reality, everything is normal. This can lead to unnecessary alarms, disrupting operations, or, in the case of safety-critical environments, causing panic or operational shutdowns.
