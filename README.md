# MQTT_Attack
The rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to an increase in devices connected to the internet, all exchanging data in real-time. One of the most popular protocols facilitating this communication is the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. Initially designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency networks, MQTT has become the de facto protocol for IoT due to its lightweight nature and efficiency. However, as with any networked protocol, MQTT is vulnerable to various security risks and potential attacks. This project aims to explore MQTT, its inherent security challenges, and common attack vectors to better understand the protocol's limitations and the risks associated with IoT networks.
